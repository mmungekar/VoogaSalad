### Each Person's Role in Developing the Project

**Kyle**

I worked primarily in the game engine. I created the algorithm and code for detecting when a collision happens and which side the collision occurs on for the two entities involved in the collision. I also worked on designing and coding Actions, Entities, and Events for the game. Additionally, I assisted in the testing and debugging the reflection used to create the lists of Actions, Entities, and Events displayed to the user in the front-end by looping through these classes in the back-end. I was also worked on exception handling within the engine. Outside of coding, I tested different game features and provided feedback to the respective areas of the team. I also organized the first demonstration and acted as the primary-spokesperson.

**Jesse**

I worked primarily on the game player. I created the menus in the player and coded the logic for populating them, along with helping to create the player itself. I also helped around in the authoring environment, game engine, and game data. Created a way to create and display game info in the authoring environment, helped make achievement entities to make displaying and updating achievements possible, and helped work on save states to save the game at any particular point. I also did game testing and helped debug various issues.

### Impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future

The project was a good culmination for that class because it provided ample opportunity to apply the design concepts we learned during the course. The size of the 
teams was also a useful experience because it requires that everyone rely on each other because no one person can take over the entire assignment. It could improve the 
project to meet with our TAs more often to show off our project and get advice because although Piazza is useful for answering questions, it doesn't provide the same help
that having someone outside of the team look at the project. Going off of that idea, the user testing was a great tool and experience because it truly demonstrates the areas
of the project that need improvement or clarification to allow someone who has not worked on the project to actually use it.
