#### Project Subgroups

Each individual in these subgroups takes primary responsibility for the subgroup's task.

In addition, members of user interface subgroups (Game Authoring Environment or Game Player) take secondary responsibility for the user interface subgroup they do not belong to. 

Likewise, members of back-end subgroups (Game Engine, Game Data) take secondary responsibility for the back-end subgroup they are not a part of.

##### Game Authoring Environment:

- Elliott Bolzan (eab91)
	- Will take responsibility for the **Entity Panel** in the Authoring Environment.
	- Will take responsibility for use cases like: creating a new **Entity**, adding an **Action**, triggered by a specific **Event**, to **Entity**; viewing **Entities** that have already been created; etc.
	- Will take responsibility for the layout of the Authoring Environment's user interface: collapsible windows, the use of `SplitPanes`, etc.
