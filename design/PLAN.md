#### Project Subgroups

Each individual in these subgroups takes primary responsibility for the subgroup's task.

In addition, members of user interface subgroups (Game Authoring Environment or Game Player) take secondary responsibility for the user interface subgroup they do not belong to. 

Likewise, members of back-end subgroups (Game Engine, Game Data) take secondary responsibility for the back-end subgroup they are not a part of.

##### Game Authoring Environment:

- Elliott Bolzan (eab91)
	- Will take responsibility for the **Entity Panel** in the Authoring Environment.
	- Will take responsibility for use cases like: creating a new **Entity**, adding an **Action**, triggered by a specific **Event**, to **Entity**; viewing **Entities** that have already been created; etc.
	- Will take responsibility for the layout of the Authoring Environment's user interface: collapsible windows, the use of `SplitPanes`, etc.

- Mina Mungekar (mem94)
	- Will create Settings panel in Authoring Environment
	- Will account for use cases which involve changing properties of Entities (i.e., setting orientation)
	- Will take responsibility for communicating changes with the back-end

- Jimmy Shackford (jas199)
    - Will take responsibility for the **Display Panel** in the Authoring Environment.
    - Will take responsibility for **Multiple Layers** within the Display Panel (foregrounds, backgrounds, etc.)
    - Will take responsibility for **Grid Tiling** within the **Display Panel**.
    - Will take responsibility for **Multiple Tabs**  within the Authoring Environment (editing multiple levels at once)

##### Game Player:

    - Will take responsibility for game controls (restart, exit, save), in-game status displays (score, timer), and the interface to the game engine
- Jesse Yue (jty4)
    - Will take responsibility for out-of-game interfaces (high score, options, etc), loading a new game, and managing save files
